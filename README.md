## Quick start

### Install

Download and install the latest Ansible plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install ansible
```

Configure your [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/ansible#configuration).

Configure your file paths in `~/.steampipe/config/ansible.spc`:

```hcl
connection "ansible" {
  plugin = "ansible"

  # Defaults to CWD
  playbook_file_paths  = [ "*.yml", "*.yaml" ]
  inventory_file_paths = [ "/etc/ansible/hosts", "~/.ansible/hosts" ]
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List all playbooks that use privilege escalation:

```sql
select
  name,
  hosts,
  jsonb_pretty(tasks) as tasks
from
  ansible_playbook
where
  become;
```

```

|          |             |     },                                                   |
|          |             |     {                                                    |
|          |             |         "name": "ensure apache is running",              |
|          |             |         "service": {                                     |

|          |             |         }                                                |
|          |             |     }                                                    |
|          |             | ]                                                        |
